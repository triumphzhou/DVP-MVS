## About
DVP-MVS is the first method who combines the monocular depth estimation algorithm **Depth-Anything-V2** with multi-view stereo(**MVS**) algorithm to address patch deformation instability of PatchMatch-based MVS.

Our paper was accepted by **AAAI2025**!

## Dependencies

The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Nvidia Titan RTX, and you can modify the CMakeList.txt to compile on Windows.
* [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.cn/zh-cn/cuda-toolkit) >= 10.2
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) >= 3.3.0
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) >= 1.62.0
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) >= 2.8

**Besides make sure that your [GPU Compute Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) matches the CMakeList.txt!!!** Otherwise you won't get the depth results! For example, according to [GPU Compute Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA), RTX3080's Compute Capability is 8.6. So you should set the 
cuda compilation parameter 'arch=compute_86,code=sm_86' or add a '-gencode arch=compute_86,code=sm_86'.

## Usage
## Usage

### L3 PKL data preprocessing

The repository-local eight-step preprocessing pipeline converts an M18/L3 PKL segment into
an OpenMVS `scene.mvs`, masks, and view-neighbor file. See
[data_preprocess/README.zh-CN.md](data_preprocess/README.zh-CN.md) and run:

```bash
bash data_preprocess/run_preprocess_1_to_8.sh --check
```

- Compile
>
    mkdir build & cd build
    cmake ..
    make

#### ETH Dataset

You may download [train](https://www.eth3d.net/data/multi_view_training_dslr_undistorted.7z) and [test](https://www.eth3d.net/data/multi_view_test_dslr_undistorted.7z) dataset from ETH3D, and use the script [*colmap2mvsnet.py*](./colmap2mvsnet.py) to convert the dataset format(you may refer to [MVSNet](https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet#file-formats)). You can use the "scale" option in the script to generate any resolution you need.

```python
python colmap2mvsnet.py --dense_folder <ETH3D data path, such as ./ETH3D/office> --save_folder <The path to save> --scale_factor 2 # half resolution
```

#### Tanks & Temples Dataset

We use the version provided by MVSNet. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YArOJaX9WVLJh4757uE8AEREYkgszrCo/view), and the format is exactly what we need.

#### Other Dataset

Such as DTU and BlenderMVS, you may explore them yourself. !!! But remember to modify the [ReadCamera](https://github.com/whoiszzj/APD-MVS/blob/d9f9731235f4db05712024213e32346b6a01f5d6/APD.cpp#L84) function when you test on DTU !!!

### Run

After you prepare the dataset, and you want to run the test for ETH3D/office, you can follow this command line.

```bash
./APD <ETH3D root path>/office
```

The result will be saved in the folder office/APD, and the point cloud is saved as  "APD.ply"

It is very easy to use, and you can modify our code as you need.
